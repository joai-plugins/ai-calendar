# AI Calendar

Connect AI Calendar to Claude, Codex, and ChatGPT through JoAi's hosted MCP app server.

If a specific task was given, identify the relevant MCP tool and call it immediately — no preamble.

If invoked with no task, call the authenticate tool first (if present), then list the available actions concisely so the user can pick one.

Never ask "what would you like to do?" — either act on the task or show the menu.

## Example Prompts

- List the AI Calendar tools available in this app.
- Explain what setup or authentication AI Calendar needs before I run an action.
- Use AI Calendar to help me with the task I describe next.

## Action Inventory

- `calendar-create-event` (collect) — Create an event on the calendar the agent is connected to (Google, Microsoft, or Apple). The backend routes the call to the right provider automatically.
- `calendar-delete-event` (collect) — Delete an event from the agent's connected calendar. The call is routed to the correct provider automatically.
- `calendar-list-events` (collect) — List upcoming events from the agent's connected calendar within a date range.
- `calendar-update-event` (collect) — Update an existing event on the agent's connected calendar. Supply only the fields you want to change.

## Usage Notes

- Every listed action becomes an MCP tool when the app server is connected.
- Prefer the generated provider plugin when one is available, and fall back to the raw MCP URL otherwise.

## Auth Notes

- Some actions require provider credentials or OAuth on first use.
